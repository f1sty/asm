# Different [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) stuff

Here is my assembly sandbox.

## Programs
- `hello_world.asm` - simple hello world program
- `read_file.asm` - this program reads itself (i.e. `./read_file.asm`)
- `print_uint64.asm` - prints different unsigned integers
- `argc.asm` - prints `argc` value
- `std.asm` - include file with common functions
